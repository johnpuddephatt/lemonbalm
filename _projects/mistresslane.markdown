title:  "Mistress Lane Community Housing"
description: |
  We developed a community consultation approach that allowed us to engage with the hard to reach community who live close to the challenging site in Armley. Through two consultation events and online activities we engaged with 56 local people who were able to participate in the design of the landscape around the new homes. We will be working with the new residents once they have moved in to co-design two social spaces around the new development.

Previous community consultations struggled to engage with people who lived directly adjacent to or overlooking the site. We were asked to provide additional support to reach these people. We developed a two stage approach to work with this very local community and allow them to participate in the design process.

We hand delivered invitations to local residents and put up posters in key local destinations: shops, post offices, the GP surgery and the entrances to the residential towers. We also designed an online survey for people who may have not wanted to speak in person but still wanted to participate.

For the first stage we held a community event with free refreshments and play activities for children. The aim was to meet these people and hear how the space is currently used, their thoughts and feelings about the site and the surrounding landscape.

Using easy to understand display boards, avoiding jargon and technical terms, we helped break down the barrier between designers and residents. We asked for their thoughts and feedback on the proposed location and massing of the new homes. We used precedent images to help inspire residents to give their thoughts on what they would like to see in the space around the new homes.

For the second stage we ran an event similar to the first but once the design had been developed. We made presentation boards that clearly explained the design and how their previous comments had influenced it.

Two spaces were identified by us and it was decided that these were going to be co-designed by the new residents of the houses once they moved in. Lemon Balm worked within existing planning structures and systems to ring fence these two areas for future design projects because of the added value to the community.

Lemon Balm worked collaboratively with Bauman Lyons Architects, Urban Wilderness Landscape Architects and our client Leeds Community Homes.
