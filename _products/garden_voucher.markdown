Purchasing a Lemon Balm consultation will allow us to find out about specific needs and give practical advice on creating the perfect garden.


## How does the voucher work?

You can purchase this voucher for yourself, or as a gift for another person. If it’s a gift and you want it delivered directly to the recipient, provide their name and address on the shipping tab during checkout.

The voucher includes contact details so you or the voucher’s recipient can speak to our team and arrange a time for us to visit.

The voucher is valid for 12 months from issue so you can choose the time of year that you prefer (we’re happy to advise if you're unsure when might be best).

## What will happen at the consultation?

We’ll visit you (or the recipient) at home and look at the garden with you, find out what it means to you, what it has been and what you hope it could be. This will take about an hour, during which time we’ll offer advice and make suggestions.

All of this information will then be typed up into a report which you can refer to in future. Each report will be tailored to you, but typically it might include basic sketches or details which you can use yourself for guidance, or show to tradespeople to make small changes. It could also include lists of plants or materials which could work well.

- **Refunds:** if, after receiving your report, you are not 100% happy with the service we will give you a full refund.
- **Garden design service:** we can also offer a full garden design service. Please email [hello@lemonbalm.org.uk](mailto:hello@lemonbalm.org.uk) or call 07595471597 for more info.
